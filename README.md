# SimpleRibbon

[BuRR](https://github.com/lorenzhs/BuRR) (bumped ribbon retrieval), but with CMake support and a **non**-header-only library to reduce compile times.

Due to this being a static library, only a small selection of configurations is available.
You can find these in the [source file](/src/SimpleRibbon.cpp).

### Library usage

Clone this repository (with submodules) and add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`.

```cmake
add_subdirectory(path/to/SimpleRibbon)
target_link_libraries(YourTarget PRIVATE SimpleRibbon)
```

You can then use it as follows:

```cpp
#include <SimpleRibbon.h>

std::vector<std::pair<uint64_t, uint8_t>> inputData = {
    {12345, 1},
    {67890, 0},
    {54321, 1}
};

SimpleRibbon<1> ribbon(inputData);  // 1-bit BuRR
uint64_t hashedKey = 12345;
uint8_t result = ribbon.retrieve(hashedKey);
std::cout << "The result for " << hashedKey << " is " << unsigned(result) << std::endl;
```
